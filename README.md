# forklift-ui

Migration Toolkit for Virtualization UI

A read-only preview with mock data is available at http://konveyor-forklift-ui-preview.surge.sh/.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.x

## Quick-start

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konveyor/forklift-ui
cd forklift-ui
npm install
```

Create a meta.dev.json file in the config directory using [`config/meta.dev.example.json`](https://github.com/konveyor/forklift-ui/blob/master/config/meta.example.json) as a template. Set the `inventoryApi` property to the root URL of your forklift-controller inventory API, and set the `clusterApi` property to the root URL of your host OpenShift cluster API. And also to be able to use VMware provider data to be analysed by Migration Analytics set the `inventoryPayloadApi` property to the root URL of your forklift-controller inventory Payload API.

**Optional**: If you plan to run webpack directly, Create a file named `.env` in the repository root, using [`.env.example`](https://github.com/konveyor/forklift-ui/blob/master/.env.example) as a template. Here you can set the `DATA_SOURCE`. Otherwise `npm run [start:dev|build]:[mock|remote]` commands will override it.

Run the UI with webpack-dev-server at http://localhost:9000:

```sh
npm run start:dev:remote  # uses real data from the REMOTE_API_URL in your .env file
npm run start:dev:mock    # uses static mock data, can run offline
npm run start:dev         # uses the DATA_SOURCE defined in your .env file
```

## Development Scripts

To run the type-checker, linter and unit tests:

```sh
# Run all 3:
npm run ci
# Or run them individually:
npm run type-check
npm run lint [--fix]
npm run test [--watch]
```

Note: the `npm run test` script will create a coverage report at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`. This is useful to inspect locally before opening a PR. Open PRs will also report their coverage to Codecov and a report will be posted in the PR.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatting is enforced by ESLint. To run Prettier and format your code (do this before committing if you don't run Prettier in your editor):

```sh
npm run format
```

To run a production build using webpack (outputs to `./dist`):

```sh
npm run build:remote  # uses real data from the REMOTE_API_URL in your .env file
npm run build:mock    # uses static mock data, can run offline or be deployed as a preview
npm run build         # uses the DATA_SOURCE defined in your .env file
```

To launch a tool for inspecting the bundle size:

```sh
npm run bundle-profile:analyze
```

## Running in production mode (run a `npm run build` first)

```sh
npm run start
```

## Configurations

- [TypeScript Config](./tsconfig.json)
- [Webpack Config](./webpack.common.js)
- [Jest Config](./jest.config.js)
- [Editor Config](./.editorconfig)

### Import paths

TypeScript is configured to allow importing modules by their absolute path. The prefix `@app/` is an alias for the main `src/app/` directory.

For example:

```ts
import { PROVIDER_TYPE_NAMES } from '@app/common/constants';
```

In general, we should use relative paths `../` when they make sense for co-located files, and absolute paths for things located near the root. The goal is to avoid long and hard-to-read relative paths.
